# Battleship

## Repository
https://github.com/sirrattoast/pfda-final-project-battleship.git

## Description
1-2 sentence description of what it will do and how it relevant to media and digital arts.
This program will allow users to run a mock 5x5 grid version of the popular game battleship. Battleship's use of randomization and strategy make for a consistently engaging media experience for users to enjoy.

## Features
- Feature 1
It will allow users to choose how many ships the player/their python opponent will be using
- Feature 2
Allow users to choose where on the grid they would like to place their personal ships
- Feature 3
The program will run code to select random coordinates, attacking the player

## Challenges
- python random number selection
- ascii art (possibly)
- updating pattern generation

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
-When players run the program, a 5x5 grid will appear in their terminal marked A-E and 1-5 asking howmany ships they would want (1-25), then they play against the program as the pattern updates every turn with info until the player wins/loses.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
-When player runs program, they're given a set number of ships. They are then asked to choose between 1-5 for row and 1-5 for column, randomly choosing coordinates against the program until they win or lose.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Allow users to store in set number coords to act as ship locations
  2. Give the program a set range of numbers that it randomly selects from.

- Week 2
  1. Establish a visual grid for reference

- Week N (Final)
  1. setup an updating quilt pattern grid for missed/hit shots
  2. setup ascii art to possibly go along with actions (succesful hits, victory, loss, etc)
