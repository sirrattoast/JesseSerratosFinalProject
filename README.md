## Description
This is a simplified version of the opoular board game 'Battleship' that can be played within your terminal! It's played on a 5x5 grid marked with 0-4 rows and 0-4 columns. This grid updates every coordinate you choose to strike with an X, allowing you not to hit the same shots twice. The game is played against a piece of code that randomly selects coordinates from the 5x5 grid. However many ships you choose to have will be how many the AI. With every action (ship choice, hit shot, missed shot, victory) there is an update message to coincide with it.

Two elements I would have liked to implement were Ascii art to go alongside the update messages, and the ability for players to choose where on the gird they would like their ships. However, with the 5x5 grid I found that the random nature of the ship placements can add a fun element to the game. 

A side note i'm proud of was going out and studying on loops further to ensure the game would not break. By not giving players the option of putting invalid inputs to break the game in the first place, it saved me quite a bit of trouble.

I really hope you enjoy playing my game! Thank you!
